# Get-EvergreenApp

## SYNOPSIS

Returns the latest version and download URL/s for an application supported by the Evergreen module.

## SYNTAX

```
Get-EvergreenApp [-Name] <String> [[-AppParams] <Hashtable>] [-Proxy <String>]
 [-ProxyCredential <PSCredential>] [-SkipCertificateCheck] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

Queries the internal application functions and manifests included in the module to find the latest version and download link/s for the specified application.

The output from this function can be passed to Where-Object to filter for a specific download based on properties including processor architecture, file type or other properties.

`Get-EvergreenApp` uses official vendor sources including update APIs, web queries, and code repository locations to return details of a target application at run time.

## EXAMPLES

Returns the current version and download URLs for Microsoft Edge using the official Microsoft Edge update API at [https://edgeupdates.microsoft.com/api/products](https://edgeupdates.microsoft.com/api/products).

### EXAMPLE 2

```powershell
Get-EvergreenApp -Name "MicrosoftEdge" | Where-Object { $_.Architecture -eq "x64" -and $_.Channel -eq "Stable" -and $_.Release -eq "Enterprise" }
```

Description:
Returns the current version and download URL for the Stable channel of the 64-bit Enterprise ring of Microsoft Edge.

### EXAMPLE 3

```powershell
(Get-EvergreenApp -Name "MicrosoftOneDrive" | Where-Object { $_.Type -eq "Exe" -and $_.Ring -eq "Production" }) | `
    Sort-Object -Property @{ Expression = { [System.Version]$_.Version }; Descending = $true } | Select-Object -First 1
```

Description:
Returns the current version and download URL for the Production ring of Microsoft OneDrive and selects the latest version in the event that more that one release is returned.

### EXAMPLE 4

```powershell
Get-EvergreenApp -Name "AdobeAcrobatReaderDC" | Where-Object { $_.Language -eq "English" -and $_.Architecture -eq "x86" }
```

Description:
Returns the current version and download URL that matches the English language, 32-bit release of Adobe Acrobat Reader DC.

### EXAMPLE 5

```powershell
Find-EvergreenApp -Name "Teams" | Get-EvergreenApp
```

Description:
Lists the available applications matching the string "Teams" (for example, Microsoft Teams), and passes the output to `Get-EvergreenApp`, which will query the matching application name. Note that `Get-EvergreenApp` will only process the first application returned on the pipeline and not all multiple matching applications.

### EXAMPLE 6

```powershell
Get-EvergreenApp -Name "MicrosoftTeams" | Save-EvergreenApp -Path "C:\Apps\Teams"
```

Description:
`Get-EvergreenApp` returns the details for the latest version of Microsoft Teams which is passed via the pipeline to `Save-EvergreenApp`. The output is used to save the target URLs to C:\Apps\Teams using a directory structure based on the returned object. In this case, the Ring and Architecture properties of the returned object will be used in the directory structure.

### EXAMPLE 7

```powershell
Get-EvergreenApp -Name "MozillaFirefox" -AppParams @{ Language = "en-GB", "es-ES" }
```

Description:
Passes en-GB an es-ES languages to MozillaFirefox to return downloads for these languages rather than the default en-US.

### EXAMPLE 8

```powershell
Get-EvergreenApp -Name "GitHubRelease" -AppParams @{ Uri = "https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/releases/latest" }
```

Description:
Passes a custom repository to the internal application function for `GetHubRelease` rather than using the repository embedded into the manifest, allowing `Get-EvergreenApp` to find the releases for an application hosted on GitHub that isn't already supported by Evergreen.
